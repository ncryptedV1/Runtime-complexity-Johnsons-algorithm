\chapter{Bellman-Ford}
Bellman-Ford is the most renowned algorithm for solving the \ac{APSP} with \ac{DP}. As opposed to Dijkstra it also works with graphs which contain negative edge weights. It also is able to detect negative cycles in graphs. \cite{Kiruthika.2012, Tamimi.2015}

On the other hand the Bellman-Ford algorithm has a runtime complexity of $O(|V|*|E|)$ which is not to be neglected. \cite{Kiruthika.2012, Tamimi.2015}
