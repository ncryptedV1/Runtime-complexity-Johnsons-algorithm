  abstract = {Now a days routing is the vital problem while forwarding information from one node to another node in communication networks. Routing in today's network is accomplished by shortest path routing algorithm. There are different algorithms for finding paths in the network. The studied algorithms are Bellmen Ford's, Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd algorithm and Johnson's algorithm. In search algorithms, when a number of nodes get increased in the network, then the number of searches and complexity of the search algorithm also get increased. In this paper, analysis/comparison of shortest path algorithm is being done and it has been concluded that researchers have got remarkable success in designing better algorithms in the terms of space {\&} time complexity to solve shortest path algorithms.},
