        There are many algorithms which solve the \ac{APSP}. By far the most renowned is Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Most of the algorithms have a pretty bad runtime complexity as for example Floyd-Warshall algorithm with $O(|V|^3)$.

        The aim of this work is to take a closer look at Johnson's algorithm. This algorithm poses an alternative to Floyd-Warshall algorithm with the goal of reducing runtime complexity.
